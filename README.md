## Purpose of this fork:

This fork was developed by Hunter as part of his internship with Inquest's Threat Intelligence Team. The purpose was to add two new c2 feed source modules - one for ThreatFox (using JSON) and one for ViriBack (using CSV). An attempt was made to develop a more generalized CSV method.
